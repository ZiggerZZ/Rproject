This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r packages}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
```

```{r}
regularite <- read.csv("regularite-mensuelle-tgv-aqst.csv",sep=";")
```
5 functinos a 
```{r}
names(regularite)
summary(regularite)
dim(regularite)
View(regularite)
head(regularite)
```
```{r}
plot(regularite$Nombre.de.trains.en.retard.au.d..part)
hist(regularite$Nombre.de.trains.en.retard.au.d..part, breaks = 20)
```
Let's tidy the data.
```{r}
regularite <- as_tibble(regularite)
```
There are 3 columns with comments. Let's check if they all are NA.
```{r}
comments <- regularite %>% select(starts_with("Commentaire"))
all(is.na(comments))
```
Apparently there are some comments. But we don't care - let's drop them.
```{r}
regularite <- regularite %>% select(-starts_with("Commentaire"))
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
